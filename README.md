# My First Flutter App
This is my first Flutter app from the Codelab written by Filip Hracek.



* The application generates cool-sounding names, such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine".

* The user can ask for the next name, favorite the current one, and review the list of favorited names on a separate page.

* The app is responsive to different screen sizes.
